# HTTP Scripting 

This project is a collection of Python scripts that measure and compare the response times of various websites. 
The scripts were primarily developed during the laboratory of the Fundamentals of Communication and Internet course.

## Description

The scripts in this project send HTTP requests to a list of websites and measure the response times. 
Response times are then compared to determine which website has the best average response time. 
The results are printed to the console and also visualized in a plot.

## Files

- `Multiple-Websites_Graphics_of_ResponseTime.py`: This script sends requests to a list of websites and plots the response times for each website.
- `Exercises/Exercice 1.1 final correct.py`: This script compares the response times of two websites and prints the website with the best response time.
- `Exercises/Exercice 1.2.py`: This script compares the response times of six websites and prints the website with the best response time.
- `main.py`: This is a sample Python script.

## Usage

To run the scripts, you need to have Python and the `requests` and `matplotlib` libraries installed. 
You can run the scripts from the command line by navigating to the directory containing the script and typing `python <script_name>.py`.
